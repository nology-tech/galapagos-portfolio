			<h3 class = "changeme">This layout looks eerily familiar...</h3>
			<p class = "changeme">If you're reading, this, you're pretty much the <strong class = "changeme">first person ever</strong> to give this webpage a spin. Congrats! <strong class = "changeme">You are a GOAT</strong> in my estimation.</p>
			<p class = "changeme">No, not the animal. What do you mean you're offended? Ah, you must have missed the <strong class = "changeme">nology galapagos quiz</strong> which took place on Friday. In which case <em class = "changeme">nology galapagos quiz</em> probably makes equally little sense to you. It's a slang term anyway. It was supposed to be a compliment.</p>
			<p class = "changeme">Well this is a great start...</p>
			<h3 class = "changeme">Hey, you didn't address the title of the previous paragraph in the body content!</h3>
			<p class = "changeme">I know. I've got to keep you reading somehow though eh?</p>
			<p class = "changeme">So, if this all looks like a rip-off of a certain "Mario Club" website, I promise you 100% that in no way are you wrong. It is. It's basically intellectual property theft (yep, the laws cover design rights... I checked...). My original design went, ahem, somewhat off-piste.</p>
			<h3 class = "changeme">Here's what I've been up to recently:</h3>
			<p class = "changeme">Check out the <strong class = "changeme">Previous Attempt</strong> link (top right) for my aforementioned attempt at a retro design for this site. It's still a work in progress!</a></p>
			<p class = "changeme">Everything else is still equally underdeveloped content-wise. For now, I've posted a handful of <strong class = "changeme">videos which I've edited</strong>, some as <em class = "changeme">pro bono</em> work for the National Secular Society, and one which was just a bit of fun—a music video for a song which my younger brother wrote and recorded.</p>
			<h3 class = "changeme" >David, where the hell is your JavaScript?</h3>
			<p class = "changeme">I think there's some included with the embedded videos! Are you saying that doesn't count? Gaah... I spent ages trying to get them to display properly...</p>
			<p class = "changeme"><strong class = "changeme">Still reading?</strong> Why not <strong class = "changeme">try out the cool features below? </strong>I mean, after the videos (which, let's face it, you were never going to watch anyway...)</p>
			<h3 class = "changeme"><a class = "changeme" href="#javascript">Click here for a very rushed JavaScript feature!</a></h3>
